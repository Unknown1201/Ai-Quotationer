System Design Document
High-Level Architecture
The system follows a classic MERN-style (or similar) architecture but emphasizes the "Preview Engine" on the frontend to minimize server load.
Data Model (PostgreSQL)
We will use a relational structure to handle the link between leads and their specific line items.

	AI Prompt Strategy
To ensure Gemini doesn't "hallucinate" or get too chatty, the backend will wrap user input in a System Prompt:


"You are a professional business consultant. Take the following raw notes and format them into a structured business proposal with the sections: Executive Summary, Detailed Scope, and Technical Stack. Use [Tone] tone. Output in valid Markdown only."
PDF Generation Flow
1. React State: Holds the Markdown and Line-Item data.
2. @react-pdf/renderer: Consumes the state to render a PDF "component" in a hidden iframe or side-pane.
3. Local Sync: Save drafts to the DB every 30 seconds (debounce) to prevent data loss.
